# This is a quick and dirty script to make sure your gateways and management servers
# have conectivity to Check Point's required servers. This does not check that the information
# returned is correct/useful or even if anything is returned. It only checks that the server
# can be reached at all.

# This is for R80+ Gaia, not embeded Gaia/VNF/SMB. See SK83520 for more information.
# This is provided as-is, no copyright implied, and is not supported by Check Point or
# myself, I just got tired of looking it all up and checking by hand.
